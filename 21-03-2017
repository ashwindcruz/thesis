1. I managed to find a Chainer vae implementation and after some tinkering, I was able to replicate the plots listed on the repo I pulled it from. However, I think it would be very beneficial to walk through your code as well and compare it against the implementation that I found. 
You mentioned at our first meeting that it would be helpful if I explicitly stated what support I could use based on my weekly work. Based on what I worked on last week, I think that advice on mastering Chainer would be very helpful. I've walked through some of the official tutorials as well as some other online resources but as you are more experienced, perhaps you have some other resources.

2. Another topic that I have been considering is what the basic architecture should be (e.g. for a vae, what should the mlp structure of the encoder and decoder be). The different models we will be considering should share some similarities to reduce bias from unwanted sources. However, if these underlying architectures are too complex, it might make comparison on the simpler datasets like MNIST more difficult. My plan here is to dive a little more into the exact experimental setups of the various papers being considered to determine which underlying architecture will be best suited for the various models.
