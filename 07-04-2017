Pre-Meeting

Discussion Points

1. How useful is it to record the ELBO per batch? 
2. How often should we record the ELBO for the entire training and testing set? 
3. Which of these is effective for examining the training procedure as opposed to comparing different models? 
4. How do we best take into account the time taken by the model to train? For example, a simpler model may utilize more iterations in an hour which perhaps might lead to better results than a more complex model within an hour. So should we be comparing models after a certain number of iterations or after a certain amount of training time?
